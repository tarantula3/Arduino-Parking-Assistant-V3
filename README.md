The ESP32-C3 Based Parking Assistant is an advanced parking sensor system that utilizes the ESP32-C3 super-mini micro-controller to provide accurate distance measurements and parking assistance.

This is the third iteration of my previously released parking assistant videos.

This parking assistant system uses ultrasonic sensors to help drivers park their vehicles accurately by providing visual and audible feedback about distance to the obstacles.
